# Fourier-Analysis-Project
This is my research project for Fourier Analysis course. 

In this research project, the main source of focus was *Relationship between Singular Spectrum Analysis and Fourier Analysis: Theory
and application to the monitoring of volcanic activity* [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0898122110003858]. The main point
of their research is that from a given time-series, there is a direct relationship between the 
singular values of a certain Hankel matrix (formed by time-series data) and the power spectrum of said time-series. 

My extension to this was applying their same analysis of graphically showing this relationship to 
a time-series data that is and has been widely available for the last couple of years: US daily new Covid-19 cases of infection. 

The code I produced is provided here. Here are the presentation slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qBoz4aLdJLV7Cb7DJnQm_8WekUsEdIEy/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107654365173598172028&rtpof=true&sd=true
